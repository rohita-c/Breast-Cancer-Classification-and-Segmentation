# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Segmentation
Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups primarily and further locating the tumor as a predecessor in surgery and chemotherapy, has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning methods. Therefore, image classification and segmentation have been identified as an aim to model the progression and treatment of patients with prevailing cancerous conditions. We use CNN for classification and U-Net for segmentation.
